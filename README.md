# CS-230-T2592-Operating-Platforms
Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
  The Gaming Room is a gaming service that is creating a program structured like a game show. They wish to create a video game for windows, mac, linux and mobile users. 
What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
  The one thing I think I did fairly well in developing my project is outlining my thoughts about which operating system they should go with to start when developing their program.
What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
  It helps you think about what you need to do next and how to complete these steps without getting overwhelmed
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
  I would revise my entire paper honestly. I would try to spend more time working on the project but due to work life balance I did not have as much time as i would have liked to complete this project.
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
  I took what the user wanted and did my best to implement it into my design. This is very important because you could create the best code in the world but if you don't meet the users needs then what was the point 
How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
  I just worked my best on the software and tried to meet the requirements. The biggest strategy I would try next time is to have a better understanding of the coding langue we used.
